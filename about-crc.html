	<p class="about-text">
CRC is a robotics competiton being held in Montreal since 2001. Every year there is a new competiton where new taskes have to be completed. The founders of CRC were not happy with the competitions out there. CRC is all about bilingualism, multidisciplinary, teamwork as well as equity. As some of the other competitions dont mind your mentors building your robot CRC is all students. At CRC its not just robots, its everything from programing to creating a kiosk, website,video, tutorial, presentation to robotics competitions. You dont have to be a "nerd" to participate in CRC.

<p class="about-text">
    Vanguard Robotics is a group of students from Vanguard High School in Montreal, Quebec, who love to build, code, and compete against others. The Vanguard Robotics program introduces students to robots and technology while providing cross-curricular skill development enrichment for students living with learning disabilities. Vanguard Robotics was founded in 2016. The team first started by competing in the First Lego League competition. Vanguard Robotics has won the Judges’ Award multiple times. In 2019, the team even reached fourth place in the competition. In 2022, the high school senior robotics team competed in the FIRST Robotics Challenge and won the prestigious Judges’ Choice Award. In 2024 the team competed in FRC and CRC. This 2025 season Vanguard Robotics Team will be competing in FRC as team 8224 and CRC as team #8. As a team we can not wait to see the outcome of this season as both the competitions are only 2 weeks from each other. It will be a real chalange but the team is up for it with lots of planing.</p>
